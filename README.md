## Getting Ready for Class

As we're on the cusp of diving into the JavaScript universe, know that **all the tools and concepts we're introducing below will be unpacked in greater detail on the first day of class**. There's no pressure for you to get everything down pat right now. This is just a preliminary peek, so when we do cover it all on day one, it'll feel like a familiar rerun rather than a brand-new show. If you're itching to get a leg up, by all means, dip your toes into the materialâ€”but know that a deep dive is scheduled for day one!

ðŸ†˜ If you're short on time, please prioritize Adopting the Bootcamp Mindset

### [Adopting the Bootcamp Mindset](https://seiremote.notion.site/Bootcamp-Mindset-4a3b687a2357409abc79a1d0eae41f59)

Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of coding with tips on how to approach your learning journey.

### [Organizing Your Learning Tools](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-organizing)

From messaging platforms to keyboard shortcuts, learn how to set up your digital workspace.

### [Intro to Developer Tools](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-dev-tools)

A brief overview of the tools developers use daily, and why they're important for you.

Remember, coding is a path of continuous learning. The more you practice, the better you'll get. So, stay curious, keep experimenting, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. See you in class!

**_A note about plagiarism_**

Picture this: even seasoned developers, the ones who've been in the trenches for years, sometimes need to look up how to do things. Like a line of code for finding even numbers, or centering a div on a webpage. Totally normal! The key, though, is they understand the code snippets they find online before they use them.

You're on this adventure to become a bona fide code wizard. That means getting into the nitty-gritty, untangling bugs, and having those lightbulb moments when a concept clicks. It's not about learning to ask AI like ChatGPT, the right questions. If you're asking ChatGPT to generate code for you, it's crucial to recognize that you might be bypassing a valuable learning experience. Understanding the logic and thought process behind the code is what molds you into a developer.  It's about understanding the answers so you can conjure up the solutions on your own.

If you ever feel lost in the code forest, wave a flag! Your instructor is there to be your guide, your mentor. Reach out, ask questions, and get clarity. That's how you grow, how you get better, and how you truly learn to code.

You've got this. And we're all here to support you on your journey to becoming a coding champ! ðŸš€
